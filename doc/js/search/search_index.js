The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatPasswordStrengthModule .forRoot()):\nimport { MatPasswordStrengthModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatPasswordStrengthModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import MatPasswordStrengthModule:\nimport { MatPasswordStrengthModule } from '@angular-material-extensions/password-strength';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatPasswordStrengthModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\nAPI\n used to calculate and display the strength of a provided password\n\n\n\noption\nbind\ntype\ndefault\ndescription\n\n\n\n\npassword\nInput()\nstring\n-\nthe password to calculate its strength\n\n\nexternalError\nInput()\nboolean\nfalse\nused to change the color of the password to warn if an external error occurs\n\n\nonStrengthChanged\nOutput()\nnumber\n-\nemits the strength of the provided password in % e.g: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% or 100%\n\n\n\n used to display more information about the strength of a provided password\n\n\n\noption\nbind\ntype\ndefault\ndescription\n\n\n\n\npasswordComponent\nInput()\nPasswordStrengthComponent\n-\nthe password component used in the template in order to display more info related to the provided password\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\nadd the @angular-material-extensions/password-strength element to your template:\n\nThis will display only the material password strength meter in form of a progress without any input fields\nor similar.\nIn the following example, we integration a material input container with @angular-material-extensions/password-strength 's component.\n\n  \n              Password\n              \n              \n                {{password.value.length}} / 25\n              \n            \n\n            \n            \n     learn more about mat-form-field\nExample of how to use the emitted strength of the password in your template\n\n                \n                \n                \n                  done\n                \n                \n                  error\n                \n                \n                  Password's strength = {{passwordComponent.strength}} %100\n                \n              Client Side password's validation using a built in angular formController\n\nadd an input element to your template with an appropriate @angular-material-extensions/password-strength's component\nhold a reference of the @angular-material-extensions/password-strength's component by adding passwordComponentWithValidation (or whatever you want) inside the element\n\ne.g: \n \n                       \nbind the form controller of the mat-password-strength to the input element \n\nyou can access the form controller of @angular-material-extensions/password-strength using the chile view --> passwordComponentWithValidation.passwordFormControl\nbind the form controller to an input element --> [formControl]=\"passwordComponentWithValidation.passwordFormControl\"\n\n\nFull example -
